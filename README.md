# friendFinder

Welcome to the Friend Finder app! Below you can find instructions on what exactly this app does and how to use it. Don't forget to run:   npm install     in order to install required packages like express if you're running the app from github.

You can also head to https://dry-bayou-39337.herokuapp.com/ and find the same app online and ready to go.


## Finding Friends

The goal of this app is to find new friends. First you'll have to take a survey and answer a series of ten questions that help describe your personality. After clicking on the Submit button, the app will compare your results with other users and find your closest match.

## JSON

On the bottom of the screen, you'll also see a link for "API Friends Link". This will bring you to a page that returns all previous users inputs in a JSON format.

## Github

You can find a link on the bottom of the page that will send you to the github page where you can see all of the code used in the making of this app. That link is here: https://github.com/moraveca/friendFinder.git
